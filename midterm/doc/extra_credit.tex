\section*{Extra credit}

Generate a movie of stochastic resonance for a black-and-white image. Do separate movies with decaying memory, {\em i.e}
$$ Y_n = (1-\alpha) X_n + \alpha Y_{n-1}$$
for various decay factors, $0<\alpha<1$.

This all or nothing extra credit will be due on April 1. It will count as two test problems.
