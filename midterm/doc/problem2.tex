\textbf{2.} A satellite orbits the sun such that, from the perspective of the earth, it has a period of $D$ days. Over this period, there is possible communication for $\alpha D$ days followed by $(1-\alpha ) D$ days of blackout when the sun is between the satellite and earth. The parameter $\alpha$ can be viewed as a duty cycle. Let $\lambda $ denote the average number of messages per day broadcast by the satellite. Over any time interval $T$ the number of messages broadcast by the satellite is therefore a Poisson random variable with a mean of $\lambda T $. During blackout, however, any messages transmitted by the satellite will not be received on earth.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Evaluate the probability mass function for $X=$ the number of messages received on earth in a period of $D$ days.
\item What is the characteristic function of $X$?
\item What is the mean and the variance of $X$?
\end{enumerate}
